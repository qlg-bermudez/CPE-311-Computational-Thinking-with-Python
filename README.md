# CPE-311 : Computational Thinking with Python
## Hello World, I’m Lorenzo Gabriel “Enzo” Bermudez

Welcome to my public GitHub repository for **CPE-311: Computational Thinking with Python**. This repository serves as a centralized workspace for my academic submissions, hands-on activities, and programming exercises throughout the course.

Each hands-on activity and project is organized into its own dedicated folder to ensure clear structure, version control, and long-term reference. This repository is intended to function both as a submission platform and as a personal academic archive.

## About Me

My name is **Lorenzo Gabriel Bermudez**, and I go by **Enzo**. I am **22 years old** and currently a **Computer Engineering sophomore** at **Technological Institute of the Philippines – Quezon City**.

I chose Computer Engineering out of a strong interest in understanding how software and hardware interact at a fundamental level. I am particularly interested in how abstract concepts such as predictive modeling, machine learning, logic, and data structures that translate into real-world systems and practical applications.

At this stage of my academic journey, I am focused on developing disciplined problem-solving habits, improving my programming fundamentals, and gaining hands-on experience through academic coursework and projects. I value learning processes that emphasize clarity, and a solid conceptual foundation, but possess curiosity for shortcuts or quick-solutions.

Outside of formal coursework, I enjoy playing games and thinking about how they are built beyond what is visible on the screen. I often find myself overanalyzing how mechanics, systems, and interactions are programmed, from high-level design decisions down to small implementation details. This habit naturally feeds my curiosity about how software behaves under the hood and influences how I approach learning and problem-solving.

## Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to:

* Store all **hands-on activities and academic submissions** related to CPE-311  
* Maintain a **clean, consistent, and organized folder structure**  
* Practice **proper documentation, version control, and code organization**  
* Build a **traceable record of technical growth** over the duration of the course  

This repository is designed to show continuity and progression in my understanding of computational thinking using Python.

## Repository Structure

The general structure of this repository follows the format below:

```
/activity-name-or-number
  ├── source files
  ├── supporting files (if any)
  └── README or notes 
```


This structure may be adjusted depending on the complexity of activities or specific course requirements, but consistency and readability will be maintained as much as possible.

## Academic Interests

My academic interests center on understanding how software and hardware systems interact in practice. I am particularly interested in programming and algorithmic problem-solving using Python, data structures and logic design, and introductory concepts in predictive modeling and machine learning. I am also drawn to systems-level topics such as computer architecture and networking, especially where theoretical concepts are applied through hands-on engineering work.

## Notes

This repository is maintained as a **public academic record** for transparency, accountability, and learning purposes. All content reflects my ongoing development as a Computer Engineering student, and some implementations may prioritize conceptual understanding and course requirements over full optimization.

The repository will continue to evolve throughout the semester as new activities, revisions, and improvements are added.

— Cheers, **Enzo**.
