I also tested if there are more optimal and more efficient ways to solve this problem and I reached the conclusion that I performed the most optimal one. I observed that the Puthon list data structure effectively simulated the physical constraints of the puzzle. And by using .pop() to remove items, and .append() to then add them to another peg, uses a Last-In, First-Out behavior. "

This method solves a complex problem by repeatedly breaking it down into smaller, simpler versions of the same problem. The data structure technique used is Last-In, First-Out (LIFO). It is a form of stacks to manage the state of the pegs."
